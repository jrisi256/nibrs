# Getting Started

## Helpful links for learning about NIBRS data

* [Jacob Kaplan's very helpful book](https://nibrsbook.com/)
* [Jacob Kaplan's very helpful hosting of NIBRS data on ICPSR](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/118281/version/V5/view). This is the NIBRS data I will be using for all analyses.
* [Jacob Kaplan's new website where he now hosts the data](https://jacobdkaplan.com/data.html)

## Limitations

* When checking which agencies report each month, I check to see if that agency reported at least one crime in that month. This is unfortunate because if an agency had no reported crime in a given month, then I wind up dropping it as not reporting when in reality it did report, **no reported crime**.
